<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Miranda Graham. I am happily married to Jason Graham and we have 5
  children between the two of us, Kaylee, Emma, Nick, Eva and Lilly. I am
  currently a Senior Change Implementation Analyst and learning the skills to
  become a web developer.

<p>
  I have a passion for the arts and diy/home projects. The mediums I enjoy most
  is working with resin, wood and acrylic painting. I have my own paintings displayed
  around my home and my eldest daughter's home. My resin pyramid piece,
  Tranquility, selected as one of the finalists in an art contest with the
  Spartanburg public library system.

<p>
  I am looking forward to applying my artistic abilities to web development and
  creating one of a kind websites that truly grab the attention of anyone who
  visits the site.
